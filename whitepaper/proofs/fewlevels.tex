\begin{proof}
    % \dznote{What is $S$? You need to condition it on the random oracle
    % giving the right output.}

    Let $S$ be the set of all blocks successfully produced by the honest
    parties or the adversary. Each block id is generated by the random
    oracle, so $\Pr[\text{id} \leq T 2^{-\mu}] = 2^{-\mu}$. These are
    independent Bernoulli trials. For each $B \in S$, let $X^{\mu}_B
    \in \{0, 1\}$ be the random variable indicating whether the block belongs
    to level $\mu$ and let $D_\mu$ indicate their sum, which is a
    Binomial distribution with parameters $(|S|, 2^{-\mu})$ and expectation
    $E[D_{\mu}] = |S| 2^{-\mu}$.

    For level $\mu$ to exist in any valid proof, at least $m$ blocks of level
    $\mu$ must have been produced by the honest parties or the adversary. We
    show that $m$ blocks of level $\mu = \log(|S|)$ are produced with
    negligible probability in $m$.

    All of the $X^{\mu}$ are independent. We apply a Binomial Chernoff
    bound to the sum. We have
    $\Pr[D_\mu \geq (1 + \Delta)E[D_\mu]] \leq \exp(-\frac{\Delta^2}{2 +
    \Delta}E[D_\mu])$. But for this $\mu$ we have that $E[D_\mu] = 1$.
    Therefore $\Pr[D_\mu \geq 1 + \Delta] \leq \exp(-\frac{\Delta^2}{2 +
    \Delta})$. Requiring $1 + \Delta = m$, we get $\Pr[D_\mu \geq m] \leq
    \exp(-\frac{(m - 1)^2}{m + 1})$, which is negligible in $m$.

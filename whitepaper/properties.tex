\subsection{Desired properties}

We now define two desired properties of a non-interactive blockchain proof protocol, \textit{succinctness} and \textit{security}. For clarity, the properties are described in the execution model of \cite{backbone} and can be easily ported to a more refined model e.g., \cite{PSS}.

\begin{definition}{(Security)}
A \textit{blockchain proof protocol} is \textit{secure} if for all environments
and for all PPT adversaries $\mathcal{A}$ the output of $V$ on round $r$ is the
same as the evaluation of $Q(\chain)$ on some honest party's chain $\chain$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{(Succinctness)}
A \textit{blockchain proof protocol} is \textit{succinct} if the maximum proof
size $|\pi|$ across all honest provers for a given round $r$ is
$O(polylog(r))$.
\end{definition}

Based on these definitions, it is trivial to construct a secure but not succinct
protocol: The prover provides the chain $\chain$ itself as a proof and the
verifier simply compares the proofs received by length: Since the longest proof
is literally the longest chain, the protocol is trivially secure but not
succinct. The challenge we will solve is to provide a
non-interactive protocol which at the same time achieves security and
succinctness over a large class of predicates.

\section{An attack against the PoPoW of \cite{KLS}}
\label{sec:attack}

In this section, we revisit the construction for interactive proofs of
proof-of-work from \cite{KLS} and its security.  Their construction is also the
starting point for our non-interactive PoPoW. We show that their
construction is susceptible to  a double-spending attack even in the case the
adversary controls a minority of the hashing power.

We proceed in two steps, we first show that a powerful attacker can break chain superquality with
non-negligible probability and then we construct a concrete double spending 
attack based on this observation.
Note that maintaining   chain superquality was  not in the original security model,  however,
we show how the property affects the security of the underlying blockchain proofs. Our  concrete attack works
under the assumption that the adversary has sufficient hashing power, but still
below $50\%$.

\noindent
\textbf{The interactive proofs of proof-of-work protocol.}
The interactive PoPoW of \cite{KLS} works as follows. The main algorithm of the verifier aims at distinguishing 
between two candidate proofs $(\pi_A, \chi_A)$ and $(\pi_B, \chi_B)$. If $\pi_A =
\pi_B$, the decision is drawn immediately without interaction based on
$\chi_A,\chi_B$. Otherwise, the verifier queries the provers for their claimed
anchored superchains $\pi_A\upchain^\mu, \pi_B\upchain^\mu$ at some level $\mu$.
The verifier starts querying at the highest possible level $\mu$ and descends
until level $\mu$ is sufficiently low such that $b = LCA(\pi_A\upchain^\mu,
\pi_B\upchain^\mu)$ is $m$ blocks from the tip of the chain for one of the proofs.
That is,
the querying stops at such $\mu$ when $max(|\pi_A\upchain^\mu\{b:\}|,
|\pi_B\upchain^\mu\{b:\}|) \geq m$. The winner is designated as the prover with
the most blocks after $b$ at that level; i.e., $A$, if $|\pi_A\upchain^\mu\{b:\}|
\geq |\pi_B\upchain^\mu\{b:\}|$, and $B$ otherwise. The communication overhead
is reduced by only requesting blocks after the purported LCA.

\noindent
\textbf{Attacking chain superquality.}
\label{subsec.superquality-attack}
We construct an adversary $\mathcal{A}$ that breaks this property at level $\mu$.
% Suppose $\mathcal{A}$ controls a portion $t/n$ of the hashing power.
$\mathcal{A}$ works as follows. Assume she wants to attack the honest party $B$
in order to have him adopt chain $\chain_B$ which has a bad distribution of
superblocks, i.e. such that local goodness is violated in some sufficiently long
subchain. She continuously determines the current chain $\chain_B$ adopted by
$B$. The adversary starts playing after $|\chain_B| \geq 2$. If
$\textit{level}(\chain_B[-1]) < \mu$, then $\mathcal{A}$ remains idle. However,
if $\textit{level}(\chain_B[-1]) \geq \mu$, then $\mathcal{A}$ attempts to mine
an adversarial block $b$ on top of $\chain_B[-2]$. If successful,  she attempts
to mine another block $b'$ on top of $b$. If successful again, she broadcasts
$b$ and $b'$. The adversarial mining continues until $B$ adopts a new chain,
which can be due to two reasons: Either the adversary successfully mined $b, b'$
on top of $\chain_B[-2]$ and $B$ adopts them; or one of the honest parties mined
a block which was adopted by $B$. In either case, the adversary continues with
the strategy by inspecting $\chain[-1]$ and acting accordingly.

Assume now that an honestly-generated $\mu$-superblock was adopted by $B$ at
position $\chain_B[i]$ at round $r$. We now examine the probability that
$\chain_B[i]$ will remain a $\mu$-superblock in the long run. Suppose $r' > r$
is the first round after $r$ during which a block is generated. $\mathcal{A}$
will succeed in this attack with non-negligible probability and cause $B$ to
abandon the $\mu$-superblock from their adopted chain. Therefore, there  
exists $\delta$ such that the adversary will be able to cause $\delta$-variance
with non-negligible probability in $m$. This suffices to show that superquality
is violated.

\noindent
\textbf{A double-spending attack. }
Extending the above attack, we modify the superquality attacker into an attacker
that causes a double spending attack in the PoPoW construction. As before,
$\mathcal{A}$ targets the proofs generated by honest party $B$ by violating
$\mu$-superquality in $B$'s adopted chain. $\mathcal{A}$ begins by remaining
idle until a certain chosen block $b$. After block $b$ is produced,
$\mathcal{A}$ starts mining a secret chain which forks off from $b$ akin to a
selfish mining attacker~\cite{selfish}. The adversary performs a normal spending
transaction on the honestly adopted blockchain and has it confirmed in the block
immediately following block $b$. She also produces a double spending transaction
which she secretly confirms in her secret chain in the block immediately
following $b$.

$\mathcal{A}$ keeps extending her own secret chain as usual. However, whenever a
$\mu$-superblock is adopted by $B$, she temporarily pauses mining in her secret
chain and devotes her mining power to harm the $\mu$-superquality of $B$'s
adopted chain. Intuitively, for large enough $\mu$, the time spent trying to
harm superquality will be limited, because the probability of a $\mu$-superblock
occurring will be small. Therefore, the adversary's superchain quality will be
larger than the honest parties' superchain quality (which will be harmed by the
adversary) and therefore, even though the adversary's $0$-chain will be shorter
than the honest parties' $0$-chain, the adversary's $\mu$-superchain will be
longer than the honest parties' $\mu$-superchain and thus will be favored by the
verifier! The formal calculation of the
probability of this attack succeeding is in the Appendix. We note that  actually, for appropriate choice of system parameters, the attack can be made to
succeed with overwhelming probability.

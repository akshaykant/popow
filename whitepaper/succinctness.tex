\subsection{Succinctness}
\label{sec.succinctness}

We now prove that our construction produces succinct proofs.

Observe that full succinctness in the standard honest majority model is
impossible to prove for our construction. To see why, recall that an adversary
with sufficiently large mining power can significantly harm superquality as
described in Subsection~\ref{subsec.superquality-attack}. By causing this harm
in superquality of a sufficiently low level $\mu$, for example $\mu = 3$, the
adversary can cause the honest prover to digress in their proofs from high-level
superchains down to low-level superchains, causing a linear proof to be
produced. For instance, if superquality is harmed at $\mu = 3$, the prover will
need to digress down to level $\mu = 2$ and include the whole $2$-superchain,
which, in expectation, will be of size $|\chain|/2$.

Having established security in the general case of the standard honest majority
model, we therefore concentrate our succinctness claims to the particular case
where there is no adversary. This case, called the ``optimistic succinctness''
case following the lead of \cite{KLS}, models the system as follows. First, the
adversary has no mining power. In other words, we set $t = 0$. This establishes
that all honestly adopted chains contain only honestly generated blocks. Second,
the adversary is unable to perform adversarial network scheduling. Instead,
network scheduling is random. What this means is that messages diffused by
honest parties are reordered in a random permutation before they are delivered
to other honest parties, but the adversary has no saying as to this order. And
last, the adversary is unable to produce any proofs; that is, all proofs
consumed by the verifier are honestly-generated. We will now explore why proofs
produced in these circumstances are succinct.

\begin{restatable}[Number of levels]{theorem}{restateThmFewLevels}
    \label{thm.few-levels}
    The number of superblock levels which have at least $m$ blocks are at most
    $\log(|S|)$, where $S$ is the set of all blocks produced, with overwhelming
    probability in $m$.
\end{restatable}

\ifonecolumn
\import{./}{proofs/fewlevels.tex}
\fi

The above theorem establishes that the number of superchains is small. What
remains to be shown is that few blocks will be included at each superchain
level.

\begin{restatable}[Large upchain expansion]{theorem}{restateThmLargeExpansion}
    \label{thm.large-expansion}
    Let $\chain$ be an honestly generated chain and let
    $\chain' = \chain\upchain^{\mu - 1}[i:i + \ell]$ with $\ell \geq 4m$.
    Then $|\chain'\upchain^\mu| \geq m$
    with overwhelming probability in $m$.
\end{restatable}

\ifonecolumn
\import{./}{proofs/largeexpansion.tex}
\fi

\begin{restatable}[Small downchain support]{corollary}{restateThmSmallSupport}
    \label{crly.small-support}
    Assume an honestly generated chain $\chain$ and let $\chain' = \chain\upchain^\mu[i:i + m]$. Then
    $|\chain'\downchain\upchain^{\mu - 1}| \leq 4m$
    with overwhelming probability in $m$.
\end{restatable}

\ifonecolumn
\import{./}{proofs/smallsupport.tex}
\fi

This last theorem establishes the fact that the support of blocks needed under
the $m$-sized chain suffix to move from one level to the one below is small.
Based on this, we can establish our theorem on succinctness:

\begin{restatable}[Optimistic succinctness]{theorem}{restateThmSuccinctness}
    \label{thm.succinctness}
    Non-interactive proofs-of-proof-of-work produced by honest provers on
    honestly generated chains with random scheduling are succinct with the
    number of blocks bounded by $4m \log(|\chain|)$, with overwhelming
    probability in $m$.
\end{restatable}

\textbf{Certificates of badness.}
To recap what we have achieved, note that we have proved security in the general
case, but succinctness only in the optimistic case where there is no adversary
present and network scheduling is random.

Examine the non-optimistic case where the adversary is allowed to provide
proofs, yet, as in the optimistic case, they have no mining power or adversarial
scheduling capabilities. It is then still possible for that adversary to produce
large incorrect proofs that use up the resources of a verifier with logarithmic
time. It is important to note that a verifier knowing ahead of time that a proof
will be large cannot conclude that the prover providing it is malicious, as an
attack on superquality of the blockchain could be taking place, requiring an
honest prover to provide long proofs.

To avoid the above undesired scenario, we now offer a generalization of our
above construction which maintains the same security. However, succinctness is
improved in that the protocol remains succinct in the optimistic case where the
adversary has no mining power, network scheduling is random, yet the adversary
\textit{is able} to produce proofs.

Our extended construction will allow the verifier to stop processing input
early, in a streaming fashion, thereby only requiring logarithmic communication
complexity even when an adversary is pushing a lot of data. To achieve this, we
observe that the honest proofs only need to be large if there is a violation of
\textit{goodness} of the blockchain. However, goodness is not harmed when the
chain is not under attack by the adversarial computational power or network.

Having made this observation, we now require the prover to produce a
\textit{certificate of badness} in case there is a violation of
\textit{goodness} in the blockchain. This certificate will always be logarithmic
in size and must be sent prior to the rest of the proof by the prover to the
verifier. Because the certificate will be logarithmic in size even in the case
of an adversarial attack on the chain, the honest verifier can stop processing
the certificate after a logarithmic time bound. If the certificate is claimed to
be longer, the honest verifier can reject early by deciding that the prover is
adversarial. By looking at the certificate, the honest verifier can determine
whether there is a lack of goodness in the underlying chain. The certificate can
only be produced when there is a lack of goodness.

The certificates of badness can be produced simply. First, the honest verifier
finds the maximum level $\text{max-}\mu$ at which there are at least $m$
$\text{max-}\mu$-superblocks and includes it in the certificate. Then, because
there is a violation of goodness there must exist two levels $\mu < \mu'$ such
that $2^\mu|\chain\upchain^\mu| > (1 + \delta)2^{\mu'}|\chain\upchain^{\mu'}|$
in some part $\chain$ of the honestly adopted chain. But $\mu' - \mu \leq
\text{max-}\mu$. Therefore, there must exist two adjacent levels $\mu_1 < \mu_2$
which break goodness but with error parameter
$(1 - \delta)^{1/{\text{max-}\mu}}$. In particular, it will hold that
$2^{\mu_1}|\chain\upchain^{\mu_1}| >
 (1 + \delta)^{1/{\text{max-}\mu}}2^{\mu_2}|\chain\upchain^{\mu_2}|$. This
condition is direct for the prover to find and trivial for the verifier to
check and completes the construction.

% \begin{definition}[Badness]
% A chain $\chain$ is called \textit{bad} if there is some level $\mu$

% \begin{definition}[Badness certification]
% A certificate of badness protocol is a proof protocol $(P, V)$ consisting of an
% honest prover $P$ and an honest verifier $V$ with the following properties:
%
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item \textbf{Correctness.} Given a bad honestly adopted chain $\chain$, the
%   honest prover $P(\chain)$ produces a certificate of badness $s$ such that
%   $V(s)$ outputs 1;
%   \item \textbf{Security.} For any adversary $\mathcal{A}$ with no mining power
%   in an environment of random network scheduling, if the adversary produces
%   some certificate of badness $s$, then $V(s)$ outputs 1 with only negligible
%   probability;
%   \item \textbf{Succinctness.} For any adversary $\mathcal{A}$ with no mining
%   power in an environment of random network scheduling, if the adversary
%   produces some certificate of badness $s$, then $V$ returns after reading only
%   the first $O(polylog(|\chain|))$ bits of the input, where $\chain$ is the
%   maximum honestly adopted blockchain.
% \end{itemize}
% \end{definition}
%
% The prover for our certificates of badness protocol is shown in
% Algorithms~\ref{alg.badness}. The prover looks for two adjacent levels $\mu$ and
% $\mu - 1$ which violate the goodness property with sufficient error
% $(1 - \delta)\rho$ so that it can be possible for them to contribute to an error
% of more than $(1 - \delta)$ across non-adjacent superblock levels.
%
% In order to make its decision, the verifier examines the provided chain of level
% $\mu - 1$ and counts the number of $\mu$-superblocks and $\mu - 1$ superblocks
% to see if the claimed error is attained.

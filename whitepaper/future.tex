% \section{Future work}
%
% Our security proof is constructed in the Backbone \cite{backbone} model with
% constant difficulty. Our construction can be extended to the variable difficulty
% setting \cite{backbone2}. We worked with a construction that allows a limited
% class of chain predicates to be proved. More predicates may be provable using a
% different NIPoPoW construction.
%
% We have constructed Proofs-of-Proofs-of-Work, but an open question remains
% whether a Proof-of-Proof-of-Stake protocol is possible, interactively or
% non-interactively.
%
% Our construction hints at a direction of sidechains, but no formalism exists
% that allows us to reason about whether NIPoPoW protocols are appropriate as
% sidechain solutions. A proper security definition for the desirable properties
% of sidechains would allow this evaluation to take place.
